AcIvServerHost.exe is a legitimate executable file associated with AutoCAD, a popular software developed by Autodesk, Inc., specifically version 23.1.47.0, which is used for computer-aided design (CAD) applications. As a component of the AutoCAD suite, it serves essential functions related to the software's operation, and it is generally considered safe when obtained from trusted sources. However, like many executable files, it can sometimes be misidentified by antivirus programs as a potential threat, leading to false positive alerts. Users may encounter errors related to AcIvServerHost.exe if the file becomes corrupted, is improperly installed, or if there are compatibility issues with the operating system, resulting in AutoCAD failing to launch or function correctly. To ensure security, it's crucial to verify the file's location, as malicious software can disguise itself with similar names, so users should always check that it resides in the appropriate Autodesk directory.
