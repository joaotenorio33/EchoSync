Generally considered safe, AdAppMgrSvc.exe is not a virus or malware; however, like many executable files, it can be targeted by malicious software, so it is important for users to ensure that the file is located in the correct directory (typically within the Autodesk installation folder) and is signed by Autodesk, Inc.
